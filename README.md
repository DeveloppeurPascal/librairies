# My toolbox for Delphi projects

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

This repository contains functions, procedures and classes to use in Delphi projects (console, VCL, FireMonkey and others). It's my "everything reuseable things" toolbox.

To know how to use those units and their features, look at samples in the "[DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-samples-and-tests](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-samples-and-tests)" repository.

Some features are [explained on my blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/librairies-publiques.html) or [live coded](https://serialstreameur.fr/librairies-et-composants.html).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

This project is part of "[DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Components-Pack](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Components-Pack)" wich include all my public components and librairies projects for Delphi developers (sometimes also useable for Pascal/Object Pascal coders outside Delphi).

It's also part of "[DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects)" repository wich installs all my GitHub content as submodules in subfolders.
