# My toolbox for Delphi projects

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

This repository contains functions, procedures and classes to use in Delphi projects (console, VCL, FireMonkey and others). It's my "everything reuseable things" toolbox.

The units to be used in your projects can be found in the "src" folder. Some features are [explained on my blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/librairies-publiques.html) or [have been coded live on Twitch](https://serialstreameur.fr/librairies-et-composants.html).

Examples of use in the form of VCL or FireMonkey projects are available in the "samples" subfolder.

Many projects using this library are available as open source on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/). Have a look in particular at the projects listed on [this repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-WorkingPrograms-Pack) or [this one](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Games-Pack). More generic Delphi projects examples are [available here](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples).

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies).

# Documentation and support

The project's technical documentation, generated with [DocInsight](https://devjetsoftware.com/products/documentation-insight/), is available in the ./docs folder and on [GitHub Pages](https://developpeurpascal.github.io/librairies). Further information and related links are available on [the project website](https://librairies.developpeur-pascal.fr).

If you need explanations or help in using this project in your own, please [contact me](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/nous-contacter.php). I can either direct you to an online resource, or offer you assistance on a fee-for-service basis. You can also contact me at a conference or an online presentation.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
