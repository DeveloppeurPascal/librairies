# My toolbox for Delphi projects

This repository contains functions, procedures and classes to use in Delphi projects (console, VCL, FireMonkey and others). It's my "everything reuseable things" toolbox.

To know how to use those units and their features, look at samples in the "[DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-samples-and-tests](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-samples-and-tests)" repository.

Some features are [explained on my blog](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/librairies-publiques.html) or [live coded](https://serialstreameur.fr/librairies-et-composants.html).

-----

This project is part of "[DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Components-Pack](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Components-Pack)" wich include all my public components and librairies projects for Delphi developers (sometimes also useable for Pascal/Object Pascal coders outside Delphi).

-----

It's also part of "[DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects)" repository wich installs all my GitHub content as submodules in subfolders.

If you don't know [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi), look at [this learning resources directory](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/index-en.html) and try my preferred IDE and programing language. A Community Edition and a Trial edition are available for free to download from [Embarcadero Technologies](https://www.embarcadero.com).

You'll also find training courses to learn Delphi and Pascal language in French on [Apprendre Delphi](https://apprendre-delphi.fr) and [resources in other languages on this directory](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).
