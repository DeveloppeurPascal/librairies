  This repository contains functions, procedures and classes to use in
  Delphi projects (console, VCL, FireMonkey and others). It's my "everything reuseable things" toolbox.

  The units to be used in your projects can be found in the "src" folder.
  Some features are explained on my blog or have been coded live on Twitch.

  Examples of use in the form of VCL or FireMonkey projects are available in
  the "samples" subfolder.
